The performance data mentioned in previous sections clearly indicate the evolution and advancement in the metrics of gyrotrons over the past 50 years, Although gyro-amplifiers have greater advantage over gyro-oscillators, all these devices are still being deployed and used in many areas of science, based on requirement. Since these devices are capable of generating a huge amount of power, they come with additional liability of misusing them in lethal weapons, something already witnessed with magnetrons in the history of wars.
