The performance data mentioned in previous sections clearly indicate the evolution and advancement in the metrics of gyrotrons over the past 50 years. Although, gyro-amplifiers have greater advantage over gyro-oscillators, all these devices are still being deployed and used in many areas of science based on each of their requirement. Since these devices are capable of generating a huge amount of power, they come with an additional liability of misusing them in lethal weapons, something that has already occured with magnetrons in the history of wars.
