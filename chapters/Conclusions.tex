Gyrotrons are promising, useful devices that find their applications in many fields, from plasma research to military technology. These devices have evolved a long way from being used as oscillators to amplifiers in cutting edge research. Further research into these devices is being conducted to operate at terahertz(THz) giving an output power in multiples of megawatt(MW) from the performance metrics of various research conducted at different institutions and companies.
